# EduTech

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Three.js: For 3D model rendering
- echo3D: For Augmented Reality
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Firestore: For Database
- GitHub Pages: For hosting

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for **Collaboration**. GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration. GitHub makes it easy to set up a project and get started. GitHub makes it easy to implement the **CI/CD workflow** and makes the deployment process easy. **Deploying** the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.

## ⛅ MLH- Best Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for **database and authentication**. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use.

## 🌐 MLH- Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude.tech . We will choose the best domain name among all.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Some of us did not have any experience with Firebase or backend. We collaborated and helped each other get up to speed. We managed to get most features we want working.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project within the given time frame.
- Creating a fully functional application.

## 📖 What we learned

- We learned how to use the best tools and frameworks to make the project work.
- How to implement Firebase authentication and Firestore database.

## 🚀 What's next for EduTech

- A mobile app version

## NOTE

This project is inspired from [chemfun.vercel.app](https://chemfun.vercel.app/). Chenges made by us for this project:

- We have added the **Augmented Reality** feature for the biology topics.
- We **rendering the 3D models** for the biology topics.
- We have deployed the project on **GitHub Pages**.
- We have changed the **UI** of the app.
