## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Three.js: For 3D model rendering
- echo3D: For Augmented Reality
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Firestore: For Database
- GitHub Pages: For hosting

## ⛅ MLH- Best Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for **database and authentication**. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use.

## 🌐 MLH- Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude.tech . We will choose the best domain name among all.

## 🤼 Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for **Collaboration**. GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration. GitHub makes it easy to set up a project and get started. GitHub makes it easy to implement the **CI/CD workflow** and makes the deployment process easy. **Deploying** the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
